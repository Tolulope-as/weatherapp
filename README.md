## The process
So i wanted to create a site where users can enter a city name and search the weather forecast for their specified city, i first wrote all my Html code which was no 
trouble then i used CSS to style it and then the major part was done using javascript , to get the weather forecast i had to integrate an API and i used 'my weather API', i created 
a free account generated a key and that key was what i used in my JS code to connect to the API. I did not want to write too much not a fan of too many words you can check out the JS code for yourself.

Thank you for taking out your time to readthis!
